In the collaborative filtering section, we built the scoring function as a weighted average to take into account different user preferences compared to a given user. In a similar manner we wish to implement similar mechanisms for the Matrix Factorization Algorithm. 

We have already established that users can be optimistic or pessimistic or neither, to take this into account, we took the deviations from the user's average when considering collaborative filtering. Similarly, we may expect certain items to be simply worse or better than other ones. To do this with matrix factorization, we will add biases.
$$\hat{r}_{ij}=w_i^Tu_j+b_i+c_j+\mu$$
Where $b_i$ is the user bias and $c_j$ is the movie bias. In collaborative filtering, the deviations are centred around 0, so there was no need to add another bias. Thus the global average $\mu$ is added to centre the dataset.
# Revisiting Training
Since we have changed our expression for the matrix factorization, and thus the squared error loss, our algorithm will have changed too. Following the same working as before, differentiating and setting to 0, we have:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& w_i=\left(\sum_{j \in \Psi_i} u_j u_j^T\right)^{-1} \sum_{j \in \Psi_i}\left(r_{i j}-b_i-c_j-\mu\right) u_j \\
& u_j=\left(\sum_{i \in \Omega_j} w_i w_i^T\right)^{-1} \sum_{i \in \Omega_j}\left(r_{i j}-b_i-c_j-\mu\right) w_i \\
& b_i=\frac{1}{\left|\Psi_i\right|} \sum_{j \in \Psi_i}\left(r_{i j}-w_i^T u_j-c_j-\mu\right) \\
& c_j=\frac{1}{\left|\Omega_j\right|} \sum_{i \in \Omega_j}\left(r_{i j}-w_i^T u_j-b_i-\mu\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
